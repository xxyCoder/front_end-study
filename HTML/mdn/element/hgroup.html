        Victor Frankenstein, a Swiss scientist, has a great ambition: to create intelligent life. But when his creature
        first
        stirs, he realizes he has made a monster. A monster which, abandoned by his master and shunned by everyone who
        sees
        it, follows Dr Frankenstein to the very ends of the earth.
